The app was developed with the objective of organizing and cleaning a folder. In my case, it was my downloads folder that was a mess. The first idea (Cleaner.py) was a simple app that grouped files depending on their file types. However, the idea evolved into implementing ML tecniques into the app. We implemented KMeans Clustering for grouping files depending on their type and name. For my case, it had a great result as the grouping was very useful and made a lot of sense. Feel free to test it yourselves and tweek some parameters to try and get better results!
